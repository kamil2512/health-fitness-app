# FitLife - Product Overview

**Your AI-Powered Personal Health & Fitness Companion**

## What is FitLife?

FitLife is a smart health and fitness app that creates **personalized meal plans and workout routines** just for you. Unlike generic fitness apps that give everyone the same advice, FitLife learns about your body, your goals, your schedule, and even your location to give you recommendations that actually work for your life.

**Live App:** https://health-fitness-app-beta.vercel.app

## The Problem We Solve

### Current fitness apps fail because:

| Problem | How it affects users |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Generic meal plans** | Suggests quinoa and kale to someone in Pakistan who can't find these ingredients |
| **Ignores your schedule** | Recommends 6 AM workouts to someone who wakes up at 8 AM |
| **One-size-fits-all** | Same workout for a 25-year-old athlete and a 50-year-old with high blood pressure |
| **No local context** | Shows prices in USD for users in India, ingredients unavailable locally |
| **Complicated tracking** | Requires manually logging every calorie and exercise |

### FitLife is different:

> "Tell us about yourself once, and we'll handle the rest."

## How FitLife Works

### Step 1: Quick Setup (5 minutes)

When you sign up, we ask a few simple questions:

1. **About You** - Name, age, weight, height
2. **Your Health** - Blood pressure, blood sugar (optional, helps us be safer)
3. **Your Goal** - Want to lose weight? Gain muscle? Just be healthier?
4. **Your Day** - When do you wake up? Work? Sleep?
5. **Your Preferences** - Vegetarian? Have a gym? Any allergies?
6. **Your Location** - City and country (so we know what food is available)

### Step 2: Get Your Daily Plan

Every day, with one tap, FitLife generates:

**Your Meals:**
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes
- Using ingredients you can actually buy in your city
- With prices in your local currency
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Exact calories and nutrition info

**Your Workout:**
- Scheduled at a time that fits YOUR day
- Uses equipment you actually have (or no equipment)
- Matched to your fitness goal
- Includes warm-up, exercises, and cool-down
- Clear instructions: "3 sets of 12 reps, rest 60 seconds"

### Step 3: Track Your Progress

- Log your weight daily (takes 5 seconds)
- See your progress on a visual chart
- Watch yourself get closer to your goal

## Key Features Explained

### 1. Location-Aware Meal Planning

**The Problem:** Most apps suggest recipes with ingredients like "organic chia seeds" or "fresh salmon" - impossible to find in many cities, or extremely expensive.

**Our Solution:** Tell us you live in Karachi, Pakistan, and we'll suggest recipes using:
- Locally available ingredients (daal, roti, seasonal vegetables)
- Realistic prices from local markets
- Cooking styles familiar to your region

**Example:**
> Instead of "Avocado Toast with Poached Eggs ($12)"
> You get "Paratha with Spiced Chickpeas (Rs. 150)"

### 2. Schedule-Smart Workouts

**The Problem:** Apps recommend workouts at times that don't fit your life. "Exercise at 6 AM!" doesn't help if you wake up at 7:30 AM and have work at 9 AM.

**Our Solution:** We calculate your free time:
- You wake at 7:00 AM
- Work from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
- Sleep at 11:00 PM

**We figure out:**
- Morning window: 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM (but need 30 min to wake up, so 7:30-8:30 AM)
- Evening window: 5:00 PM - 11:00 PM

**Result:** "Your 35-minute workout is scheduled for 6:30 PM - after work, before dinner."

### 3. Health-Conscious AI

**The Problem:** Generic fitness advice can be dangerous for people with health conditions.

**Our Solution:** If you tell us you have:

| Condition | What we do |
|-----------|------------|
| **High blood pressure** | Automatically removes high-sodium foods (no soy sauce, processed meats, excess salt) |
| **High blood sugar** | Suggests low glycemic foods (no white rice, white bread, sugary items) |

We mark these as **critical rules** - the AI cannot ignore them.

### 4. One-Tap Daily Planning

**The Problem:** Most apps require you to:
1. Search for recipes
2. Calculate calories
3. Find a workout
4. Figure out timing
5. Make a shopping list

**Our Solution:** One button. "Generate My Plan." Done.

In about 10 seconds, you have your entire day planned - breakfast, lunch, dinner, and workout.

### 5. Visual Progress Tracking

- Simple weight log (just enter a number)
- Beautiful chart showing your journey
- Goal line so you can see how close you are
- Notes to remember what affected your weight ("ate out yesterday", "started new workout")
